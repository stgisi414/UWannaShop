Proof of Concept (POC) - Revised
1. Concept/Idea Name:
Gemini-Powered Customer Service Chatbot for PERN-based E-commerce Platform (Express Store International)

2. Problem it Solves:

Provides immediate, 24/7 customer support for common queries within a modern Single Page Application (SPA).
Reduces customer service workload and associated costs.
Enhances user experience by offering personalized and context-aware assistance based on the user's real-time activity and application state within the React frontend and backend session.
Improves accessibility of information regarding products, pricing, and company policies.
3. Proposed Solution:

Backend (Express.js API):
Develop a dedicated API endpoint (e.g., /api/chatbot) to handle interactions.
This endpoint will securely fetch instructional data (product details, prices, company info) from the PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.
It will receive contextual information (as JSON) from the React frontend, potentially combined with server-side session data managed by Passport.js.
It will format the instructional data and the received/retrieved context into a structured prompt for the Gemini API.
It will call the Gemini API and return the response to the frontend.
Frontend (React SPA):
Create a reusable React component for the chatbot interface using Tailwind CSS for styling, shadcn/ui for components (like Dialog, Input, Button, ScrollArea), and Lucide React for icons.
This component will manage the chat history state.
On user submission, it will gather relevant frontend context (e.g., current route/view, relevant component state like cart contents, user auth status from context/store) and send it along with the user's message to the backend /api/chatbot endpoint.
It will display the AI's response within the chat interface.
Data Flow: User Input -> React Chatbot Component -> Gather Frontend Context -> Axios/Fetch Call to /api/chatbot -> Express API Endpoint -> Fetch DB data (Drizzle) & Combine Context -> Gemini API Call -> Response -> Express API -> React Component -> Display Response.
4. Key Features to be Tested:

Contextual Understanding: Can the chatbot accurately answer questions about products/prices/company based on data retrieved from PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM?
State Awareness: Can the chatbot understand and utilize the combined JSON context (React state + Passport.js session info) to provide relevant responses? (e.g., "What's in my cart based on my current React state?", "I'm logged in via Google, how do I change my address?").
Data Ingestion & Transmission: Can the React component successfully gather and send its state, and can the Express backend successfully combine it with session data and pass it to Gemini?
Basic Interaction: Does the React chatbot component allow for a fluid multi-turn conversation?
Response Accuracy: Are responses accurate based on the provided database info and the dynamic context?
5. Success Criteria:

Chatbot correctly answers 85%+ of test queries related to product/price/company data fetched via Drizzle.
Successful demonstration of utilizing combined React state and session context in at least 5 distinct test scenarios.
Reliable transmission and formatting of JSON context data from React through Express to Gemini API confirmed via logging/testing.
Chatbot maintains conversational coherence for at least 3 turns in test dialogues.
End-to-end response latency (User input to response displayed) averages under 5 seconds during tests.
6. Assumptions and Constraints:

Access to the Gemini API is available.
Proficiency within the team regarding PERN stack, Drizzle ORM, Passport.js, React state management, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and API integration.
Feasibility of securely gathering and transmitting relevant, non-sensitive React state and session data.
POC scope limited to informational queries and guidance, not performing actions (API calls beyond the chatbot interaction itself).
POC utilizes controlled test data and scenarios.
Potential constraints include API rate limits, network latency, and the complexity of accurately capturing all relevant context.
7. Visual Aids (If Applicable):

(Optional: A diagram showing the React Component -> API -> Drizzle -> Gemini -> API -> React Component flow).
